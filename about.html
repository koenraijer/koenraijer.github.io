                <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">The public nature of a blog will hopefully serve as a vehicle to improve my thinking and writing. </h3>
                <p>Although I spend most of my time doing medical rotations, I very much enjoy venturing into worlds completely different. Doing so is a very welcome side step. I recently took on the challenge of learning to code, and I'm currently learning the general principles of computer science, which has opened up a completely new world of fascinating concepts to write about.</p>

            <p>I enjoy learning new stuff so the list is very much non-exhaustive! I also enjoy working out, producing music, getting into heated discussions and getting sucked into internet deep dives.</p>
