                <div>
                    <p>I'm a 20-something fifth year medicine student from the Netherlands who enjoys learning new stuff and writing about it. Some things I'm particularly curious about are health tech, psychedelics research and mental health, data science, programming, and ethics. Some of my favourite pastimes are working out, playing and producing music, getting into heated discussions and getting sucked into internet deep dives.</p>
                    <p>This website is a byproduct of me keeping myself busy during COVID back in September of 2020. I hadn't been doing medical rotations for over half a year and I was running out of things to do. I tried my hand at programming, which turned out to be exactly the challenge I needed.</p>

            <h3 class='post-h4'>Why a blog?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>I have been keeping notes in my phone about stuff that fascinates me for a long time, but I would never <i>really</i> try to think them through. There's no one reading them but me.</p>
                <p>Even though it would be really cool if people get some benefit out of my writing, it's not the goal. In fact, even if no one bothers to read my stuff, blogging is still useful. The <i>possibility</i> of someone reading it adds a sense of urgency to it that private notes don't have. I hope that urgency will sharpen my thinking and writing skills.</p>
                <p>Blogging is also a good excuse to read and learn about stuff unrelated to medicine. I enjoy diving into new ideas and concepts and I love having those aha moments where something clicks and you suddenly understand something that seemed impenetrable at first.</p>

            <h3 class='post-h4'>How this website was made</h3>
            <p>The website is made using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and hosted for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Jekyll is a "static site generator" that's very intuitive to learn if you know some HTML and CSS. Github Pages is a Github service that allows users to host static websites for free. Both services have excellent documentation!</p>
