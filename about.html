    <p>ðŸ‘‹ I'm a 22-year old fifth year medicine student from the Netherlands. I write about health tech, mental health and psychedelics research, data science, programming, and ethics. I like working out, playing music, reading books and getting sucked into internet deep dives.</p>

<h3>Why a blog?</h3>
<blockquote>"If people cannot write well, they cannot think well. And if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them." - George Orwell</blockquote>
<p>I have been keeping notes in my phone about stuff that fascinates me for a long time, but I would never <i>really</i> try to think them through. I'd just forget about them until I'd add another idea to the list. This is where I try to mold those notes into something readable.</p>
<h3>How this website was made</h3>
<p>I made this website using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It is hosted for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Jekyll is a static site generator that's very easy to get the hang of if you know some basic HTML and CSS. Github Pages is a Github service that allows users to host static websites for free. Both services have excellent documentation!</p>
