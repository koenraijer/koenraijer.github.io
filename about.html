                    <p>&#128075; I'm a 22-year old fifth year medicine student from the Netherlands. You can expect posts on here about health tech, psychedelics research and mental health, data science, programming, and ethics. My favourite pastimes are working out, playing music, reading books and getting sucked into internet deep dives.</p>

            <h2 class='post-h4'>Why a blog?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>I have been keeping notes in my phone about stuff that fascinates me for a long time, but I would never <i>really</i> try to think them through. I'd just forget about them until I'd add another idea to the list. This is where I try to transform some of them into something readable.</p>

            <h2 class='post-h4'>How this website was made</h2>
            <p>The website is made using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and hosted for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Jekyll is a "static site generator" that's very intuitive to learn if you know some HTML and CSS. Github Pages is a Github service that allows users to host static websites for free. Both services have excellent documentation!</p>
