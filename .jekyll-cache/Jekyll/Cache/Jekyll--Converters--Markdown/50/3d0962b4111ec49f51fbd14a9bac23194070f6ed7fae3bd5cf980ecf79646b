I"J<p>I wanted to start a blog a while back, so I made a Medium post. In the meantime I made this personal website, which made me want the blog to be on the actual website.

Then I tried WordPress, but that’s just confusing and bulky. So I read about Jekyll, and this is my first Jekyll-powered blog post!</p>
