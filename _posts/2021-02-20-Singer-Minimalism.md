title: "When Peter Singer joins forces with minimalism"
---

In Peter Singer's compelling essay titled <i>Famine, Affluence and Morality</i>, he argues that most people in affluent countries are <b>morally obliged</b> to give way more money to charity than they currently do. I previously wrote a [short summary]({% post_url 2020-02-05-Singer-Summary %}) of it.

The essay does a wonderful job substantiating its point. While many ethical theories are shrouded in vagueness or clouded with jargon, this one is not. It's easy to understand. THe message is short and powerful. 

As much as it is powerful, it is also very awkward. Adhering to Singer's idea means turning your whole life upside down. If you believe in the truth of this essay but you haven't <i>acted</i> on it <b>yet</b>, every purchase you make will come with a sense of guilt. If you belong to that group, you will probably stay inspired for a couple of weeks. You'll tell your friends about it, and some of them might also read the essay. Eventually, life will continue as usual. While your mind gets occupied by new ideas, the unease you felt before at the thought of buying new stuff slowly diminishes as you forget about the urgency of Singer's message. 

The above is exactly what happened to me. We need <b>more reason</b> to buy less stuff <i>permanently</i>. The problem is that the continuous pull from advertisements which bombard us every moment of the day, is too large for Singer's essay to resist all by itself. It needs allies. 

There happens to be another movement that wants people to buy less stuff. It also needs allies. It's called <b>minimalism</b>, and it's about being more mindful about the stuff you need, and the stuff you don't. It wants you to ask yourself if you <i>need</i> this item and if it makes you <i>happy</i>. That's a good message in today's world. 
It came to my attention after watching this (pretty mediocre) <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3810760/">Netflix documentary</a> in 2015. Around the same time, Marie Kondo got famous for her books on tidying up your house.

Since then, the movement's motives slowly deteriorated. Slowly but surely, the emphasis shifted from an attitude towards objects, to an aesthetic movement. Instead of trying to live with less stuff, minimalists increasingly urged you to </i>replace</i> your current stuff with other stuff that "looks minimal". Consider the commercial genious behind Marie Kondo. First she tells you to throw away your stuff, only to <a href="https://konmari.com/">sell</a> you her own stuff. Minimalism's initial, anti-consumerist agenda has been commercialized. Evidently, it couldn't resist the forces of the advertising industry.  

Why did that happen? Consider what happens if you subscribe to the ideas minimalism preaches: you buy less stuff. You're now left with more money, and you haven't found a new purpose for it yet. If we make Peter Singer and minimalism join forces, we have found that purpose. We now have a powerful pull away from buying new stuff, and a meaningful purpose for the money we're left with: charity.
