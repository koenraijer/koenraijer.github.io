title: Some thoughts on the ethics of patient triage and scarce-resource allocation during COVID-19 
---

### If you don't change a thing
Allow me to set the stage. There's a limited amount of beds in Intensive Care Units and an increasing amount of COVID-19 patients. The goal here is to <i>save as many lives as possible</i>.
Imagine the following scenario. You go on admitting patients as per usual and patients will get an ICU bed on a first-come-first-serve basis, until there are no more ICU beds. 
The only selection that has taken place is based on chance; some patients were lucky enough to need an ICU bed <i>before</i> it was full. Other patients happened to become ill too late, even though they may have had a much bigger survival chance than patients who are already in the ICU. We need to be more strict if we're going to save as many lives as possible. 

### Medical triage
Imagine a new scenario using the Dutch protocol for ICU care during the COVID pandemic. As ICUs nationwide are filled for more than 80%, stricter criteria for medical triage come into action that overrule hospital policies. Patients who have very high mortality rates are denied ICU admission. Think of severely injured car crash victims, but also people who score very high on the Clinical Frailty Scale (follow the link for more info). As the amount of patients keeps soaring, even stricter criteria come into action. The time window between admissions becomes smaller and smaller. At some point, two patients may present at the same time. They both meet the criteria, but there's only one bed. The patient with the highest survival chance <i>with ICU admission</i> now gets the bed. But what happens if the doctor isn't sure which patient has a higher chance of survival? 

### Non-medical triage
This is where non-medical triage comes into play. It is very important to realize that any decision you make for choosing one patient over the other has <i>is not a medical decision</i>. Both patients are <i>equally eligible</i> for ICU admission. Any factors that have a significant impact on the patients' survival chance have already been taken into account during <i>medical triage</i>.

The first criterium is not very controversial: patients who are likely to require a shorter ICU stay take precedence. This will save more lives. The second criterium prioritizes healthcare workers who've been at risk during times where face masks etc. were scarce. Although this may be controversial to some, it is not something I want to discuss here. 
The third criterium prioritizes treatment to patients who are part of a younger generation. The Dutch protocol defines a generation as a period of 20 years: 0-20, 20-40, 60-80, 80 and up. It is based on the <i>fair innings argument</i>.
