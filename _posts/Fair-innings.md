title: How valid is the fair innings argument in the context of the "black scenario" during the COVID pandemic in The Netherlands?
---
I'm writing this in light of the recent public discussion in The Netherlands about triaging patients based on non-medical criteria when ICUs are full, often colloquially referred to as the black scenario. When I refer to the black scenario, I specifically mean the scenario where triage can no longer be based on medical criteria and must therefore be based on non-medical criteria. Months after the release of the first Dutch protocol for ICU care during the COVID pandemic (source), the Dutch secretary of hospital care issued a public statement objecting against an age-based criterium in the black scenario. This was met with harsh criticism from the medical community as well as society at large (source). 
In this article, I will describe the context of the black scenario in The Netherlands and then discuss the validity of the fair innings argument <i>in this context</i>.
<br><br>
Instead of a first-come-first-serve basis, it is well established that in order to save as many lives as possible, triage based on medical criteria is necessary (source). The way this triage is supposed to happen is detailed in the Dutch Protocol for ICU care during the COVID pandemic (source). It comes into action when ICUs nationwide are filled for more than 80% and it consists of three phases. Phase A defines stricter inclusion and exclusion criteria for the admissal of patients to the ICU that overrule hospital policies everywhere. If this does not sufficiently decrease the amount of people eligible for ICU admission, phase B comes into action, which defines even stricter, albeit medical, criteria. If at some point, two patients are eligible while there is only one bed, a choice has to be made based on a <i>difference in estimated survival chance (with ICU care).</i>. If distinguishing is not possible, we arrive in the black scenario, where triage happens based on non-medical criteria.

### Clarifying the implications of non-medical triage and justifying societal and political interference. 
It is crucial to understand the sharp divide between medical and non-medical triage. Any criterium defined hereafter is not backed by medical science. Although I acknowledge the value of real-world experience with difficult decisions like these and the weight of having the responsibility to <i>act</i> on these criteria, it is definitely not <i>solely</i> for the medical specialist to decide what to do here. At the core, this issue concerns itself with big concepts like fairness, justice and ethics. I therefore consider societal and political interference to be justified. 

### Non-medical triage criteria
The protocol states that firstly, the patient who is expected to require the shorter ICU stay is to be prioritized. Secondly, under certain strict conditions, healthcare workers are given priority (this discussion about the ethics of this criterium falls outside of the scope of this article). The third argument mentions the <b>fair innings argument</b> (FIA) for the first time, using it to justify prioritization of patients belonging to the younger generation. A generation is in this case, seemingly arbitrarily, defined as a period of 20 years. If two patients fall in the same generation, a lottery-based system decides who gets the ICU bed. 

### The fair innings argument
"The fair innings argument takes the view that there is some span of years thatwe consider a reasonable life, a fair innings. Let’s say that a fair share of life isthe traditional three score and ten, seventy years. Anyone who does not reach 70suffers, on this view, the injustice of being cut off in their prime. They havemissed out on a reasonable share of life; they have been short-changed. Those,however, who do make 70 suffer no such injustice, they have not lost out butrather must consider any additional years a sort of bonus beyond that whichcould reasonably be hoped for. The fair innings argument requires that everyonebe given an equal chance to have a fair innings, to reach the appropriatethreshold but, having reached it, they have received their entitlement. The rest of their life is the sort of bonus which may be cancelled when this is necessary to help others reach the threshold."

### Problems I've noticed with the fair innings argument
#### The length of one's life may not be the only determinant of what a fair share is
Imagine one 50 year old wealthy person with a job they're passionate about, a loving partner and a caring social circle. Imagine another 70 year old who's finally enjoying their retirement after a life of hard work, together with their newfound love. Imagine yet another suicidal 30 year old. 
The 30 year old will take precedence over the 50 year old, who will take precedence over the 70 year old. Subjective life satisfaction is completely disregarded here. Now, I understand that some people might not be convinced by these examples, but change the conditions to your liking and the argument remains the same. I understand that it may not be possible to measure life satisfaction with sufficient objectivity, and it's even harder in the COVID triage setting. 
I would instead argue that <i>because</i> there are other factors -measurable or not- that influence what a fair share is, <i>only</i> taking age into account in practice creates an asymmetrical decisionmaking process that puts too much emphasis on one particular factor. 

#### Edge cases
When considering the legitimacy of the fair innings argument it is important to do so in the context of a <i>heavily-triaged patient population</i>. The evidence for 20-year generations is shaky at best and arbitrary at worst. The protocol argues that edge cases; situations where a 59-year old is prioritized above a 61-year old, are unavoidable in any other system. I will argue otherwise in the alternative solutions I will offer to the problem. 

### Does thinking in large numbers change anything

### Can an age-based weighted lottery system function as a valid replacement for criterium 3 and 4? Can chance compensate uncompensated and hard-to-measure significant factors like quality of life and life satisfaction?
