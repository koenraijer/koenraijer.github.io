## The plan for 2021
{: .post-h2}

1. Complete Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science.
2. Learn data analysis using Python. Get good at interactive data visualization; data exploration, manipulation and analysis. Will probably choose an online (clinical) data science course for this. Don't neglect regular statistics in the process. 
3. Do a course in mathematics relevant to programming/data science. 
4. Practice my writing by posting stuff on here. 


#### Rationalization

1. Technology will change healthcare in ways I find very fascinating and also very hard to imagine. Programming knowledge will hopefully allow me to ride that wave.  
2. Python is a more versatile future-proof way of doing data analysis and machine learning, contrary to legacy software like SPSS. I also like the many ways to integrate graphs with websites and make them interactive. Science communication can be made more effective; among professionals, but also towards the general public. Effective data visualizations that work well with phones are crucial for that. 
3. Programming forces me to think in ways I don't usually need to think. I hope there's some carry-over to my problem solving skills at large. 

#### Reasons to get a personal website

1. A historical document of my writing which serves as a future work of reference. 
2. Maximum freedom, fully customizable. Although there's no denying the value of LinkedIn's traffic, it is very limited in its appearance and structure.
3. Full ownership of my content and independence from the whims of big tech companies. No privacy issues.
